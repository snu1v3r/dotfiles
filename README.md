# My Custom Dotfiles
This repository contains my custom dotfiles for *Zsh*, *Vim* and *Tmux*. Initially I used various repositories from other persons, but these contained a lot of other configurations from which I didn't know exactly what it was doing and in what way or form they conflicted with eachother. Therefore I switched to a vanilla setup that only contains the settings that I specifically use. Besides the settings for the various programs it also contains a deployment script that is used for installation. Next the repository contains a list with resources where pieces of code or environment suggestions where found.

# Installation
Installation is very easy. It only contains two steps:
```default
$ git clone https://github.com/snu1v3r/dotfiles.git
$ ~/dotfiles/deploy
```
