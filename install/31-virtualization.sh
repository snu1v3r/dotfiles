    # Notes with respect to Qemu
    # Qemu can be use with a qemu:///system connection string or a qemu:///session
    # connection string qemu:///system has full networking capabilities, but has to be started with system user privileges.
    # qemu:///session can be started as a regular user. Only downside is limited networking capabilities. This doesn't directly affect outgoing connections, but limits incoming connections. To enable incomming connection within a qemu:///session
    # connection string the passt application together with portforwarding is used. 
    # passt is installed in the section above.
    # Furthermore the .xml file for the NIC in the virt-manager needs to be modified
    # to setup port forwarding. An example is given below. The two relevant elements are <portForward...> and <backend...>
    #
    # ```xml
    # <interface type="user">
    #   <mac address="52:54:00:a4:85:7d"/>
    #   <portForward proto="tcp">
    #     <range start="4022" to="22"/>
    #   </portForward>
    #   <model type="rtl8139"/>
    #   <backend type="passt"/>
    #   <alias name="net0"/>
    #   <address type="pci" domain="0x0000" bus="0x10" slot="0x01" function="0x0"/>
